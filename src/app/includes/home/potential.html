			<p>
				A land of profound tradition, vision and ambition, Dubai has been a bustling maritime destination for centuries. Strategically situated at the crossroads of the great East-West silk route, trading by sea has been fundamental to the growth of the emirate’s economy.

				Today, under the rule of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai,
				our pioneering metropolis continues to challenge boundaries, defy odds and create unparalleled opportunities.
				In its advancements, Dubai is fast becoming a global economic capital and one of the most desirable destinations in the world for business owners, investors and settlers.
