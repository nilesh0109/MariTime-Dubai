				World-class infrastructure, a multitalented and multicultural populace, zero capital gains and a stable political system - Dubai is a destination of distinction. Whichever direction you turn, the innovation in this progressive city is palpable, and the opportunity incomparable.  Sharing this forward-thinking attitude and approach, the Dubai Maritime City Authority’s (DMCA) goal is to create a vibrant and safe maritime environment in Dubai, and become the global economy’s fundamental business center by 2021. To achieve this, we are implementing best international practices in the organization, executing key management projects and following a path of success unique to our own identity.
